This means that last octet, and the first bit of the third octet are addressable

so we have 9 bits we can address, the first 23 are locked in.
This means that the network is 128.39.120.0 with hosts ranging from 
128.39.120.1 - 128.39.121.254

VLSM exercise 1

1 Allocate the address space of LAN 1

Consider the network outlined in Figure 5. The four LANs, “LAN 1”, “LAN 2”, “LAN 3” and “LAN 4” shall share the network address 10.0.1.0/24 and your task is to use VLSM to subnet it. Figure 1 illustrates the maximum number of Hosts that each LAN is required to accommodate. You are asked to assign address ranges to the different LANs. They should be sufficiently large according to the required number of hosts on each LAN, but not larger. Note that by “hosts we do not include the addressing requirement of the router, so when we require LAN2 to accomodate 5 hosts, we must set aside at least 6 unicast IP addresses; i.e 5 IP addresses for the host’s requirement and one IP address for the router interface. 

There are many ways of subnetting with VLSM. In this task, however, you are asked to assign address blocks from the beginning for the address space, and you start with the largest LANs so that a LAN that requires a large block will be assigned an address before a LAN with a smaller address block. Subnet-zero(ALL-zero Subnet) and All-Ones Subnet will be used. 

1.1 Subnet the original address space into blocks which are sufficiently large to accommodate the largest LAN(LAN1) and assign the first available block to LAN1. What is the size of the IP address block for LAN 1, and what is the subnet mask?  
address: 10.0.1.0/24

/25 is the subnet mask of LAN1 and the size of the IP address block is 128. 
10.0.1.0/25 LAN1

1.2 If Host A is assigned the third available IP address in the block, which address will it obtain? 
10.0.1.0/25 ~ 00001010.00000000.00000001.00000000

subnet range ~ 11111111.11111111.11111111.10000000
net.address.00001010.00000000.00000001.00000000 ~ 10.0.1.0
broad.address: 00001010.00000000.00000001.01111111 ~ 10.0.1.127
host min:00001010.00000000.00000001.00000001 ~ 10.0.1.1
host max:00001010.00000000.00000001.01111110 ~ 10.0.1.126

Third available IP address in the block: 10.0.1.3


2 Allocate the address space for  LAN 3 and LAN 4
2.1 Split the second block into a number equal-sized blocks that are sufficiently large to accommodate the second largest LAN, which is LAN 3, and assign the first block to LAN 3. Since the thirds biggest LAN, LAN 4, also fits into this block size, assign the second block to LAN4. What are the network address and network mask of LAN 3 and LAN 4? 

2.2 If host C is assigned the first available address in the address range of LAN 3, which address does it obtain?

10.0.1.128/27 ~ 00001010.00000000.00000001.10000000
subnet range: 11111111.11111111.11111111.11100000
net.address:  00001010.00000000.00000001.10000000 ~ 10.0.1.128
broad.address: 00001010.00000000.00000001.10011111 ~ 10.0.1.159
host min:00001010.00000000.00000001.10000001 ~10.0.1.129
host max: 00001010.00000000.00000001.10011110 ~ 10.0.1.158

If it is assigned the first available address in the address range of LAN 3,  it obtains 10.0.1.129

2.3 If host D is assigned the last available address in its block, which address does it obtain? 

10.0.1.160/27 ~  00001010.00000000.00000001.10100000

subnet range: 11111111.11111111.11111111.11100000
net.address: 00001010.00000000.00000001.10100000 ~ 10.0.1.160
broad.address: 00001010.00000000.00000001.10111111 ~ 10.0.1.191
host min:00001010.00000000.00000001.10100001 ~ 10.0.1.161
host max: 00001010.00000000.00000001.10111110 ~10.0.1.190

The last available address in Ds block it obtains is 10.0.1.190

3 Allocate the address space for LAN 2
3.1 Subnet the third available block from the previous point into a number of blocks which are sufficiently large to accommodate LAN 2, and assign the first block to LAN 2. Host B is assigned the second last address in the block - which address is this? 

10.0.1.192/29 ~ 00001010.00000000.00000001.11000000

subnet range: 11111111.11111111.11111111.11111000
net.address: 00001010.00000000.00000001.11000000 ~ 10.0.1.192
broad.address: 00001010.00000000.00000001.11000111 ~ 10.0.1.199
host min: 00001010.00000000.00000001.11000001 ~ 10.0.1.193
host max: 00001010.00000000.00000001.11000110 ~ 10.0.1.198

Host B is assigned 10.0.1.197 which is the second last address in the block

3.2 How much of the address space did you assign, and how much is left unused and available for future assignment. 

From address 10.0.1.200 I have addressed, meaning that up to 255 there are unused addresses.
